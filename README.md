# SunSensor
initial publish
This was a fun project I did using an Arduino powered by 4 AA batteries to measure how long the sun was up in a specific spot.
It is no longer assembled, so I haven't updated the code in quite some time. It certainly could be better, but may be useful for some people. I have a video on YouTube with it in action, if you're interested. YouTube video also has links to dropbox to a diagram for how to wire it.
